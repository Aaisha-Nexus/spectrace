# Project Progress

- **Date:** 2026-08-29
- **Milestone 4:** Direct-Prompt Baseline
- **Status:** In progress; offline implementation and dry-run validation completed

## Completed

- Milestone 1 project foundation retained
- Local Git repository initialized
- Private GitHub remote connected
- Python 3.13 virtual environment created
- Missing pip repaired with `python -m ensurepip --upgrade`
- Provider-neutral project-control skeleton created
- Five-label taxonomy frozen
- Privacy, formatting, TOML, package, ignore, and staging validations passed
- One wholly fictional StudioLane benchmark authored and manually audited
- Predetermined ground truth frozen before any model run
- Evidence IDs, decision chronology, evidence cutoffs, human outcomes,
  supersession, and cumulative-drift expectations validated
- Strict Pydantic schemas added for requests, ground truth, predictions, and
  evaluation results
- Generic dataset validation and frozen-demo assertions implemented
- Per-request temporal evidence availability enforced for citation scoring
- Deterministic five-label classification, clarification, contradiction,
  citation, and cumulative-drift metrics implemented without an API
- Strict Evidence-Grounded Scope Accuracy defined and tested
- Constructed-fixture dataset and scoring tests passing on Python 3.13
- Provider-aware Google GenAI configuration and structured-output adapter added
- Fixed direct-prompt instructions and SHA-256 prompt hashing added
- Per-request temporal prompt reconstruction implemented without future evidence
- Independent, stateless request calls and bounded structured-output retries implemented
- Raw responses, parsing failures, run metadata, and per-request assembled-input
  hashes can be preserved during a future approved run
- Configuration validation completed without displaying the API key
- Offline dry-run validation completed for CR-001, CR-007, and CR-010
- No Gemini/model API call has been made and no baseline result exists yet

## Milestone 2 benchmark files

- `data/synthetic/demo_project/sow.md`
- `data/synthetic/demo_project/decisions.md`
- `data/synthetic/demo_project/requests.json`
- `data/synthetic/demo_project/ground_truth.json`

No model or API has been run against the benchmark.

## Milestone 3 files

- `spectrace/models.py`
- `spectrace/dataset.py`
- `spectrace/scoring.py`
- `tests/test_dataset.py`
- `tests/test_scoring.py`

## Deliberately not implemented

- Advanced agent
- Streamlit interface
- Retrieval, persistent ledger, verification pass, or agent tooling in the baseline
- Real model predictions or measured baseline performance

## Next step

Review the offline baseline, then perform one explicitly approved smoke-test API
call before any full ten-request run.
